# Py-script-for-FEA-in-Abaqus
This script is to run the finite element analysis (FEA) in Abaqus varying multiple parameters in the model.
* 'oe_run.py' file is to run the script in Abaqus. It gives multiple finite element analysis (FEA) results changing various parameters in the model.
* 'oe_data_process_new.py' file is to process bulk results at once, leading to tissue level stress and strain (calculated from the model dimensions typed in) information only.
* Model and part files are not provided.
* Detailed explanation and others will be updated when the manuscript is accepted.
